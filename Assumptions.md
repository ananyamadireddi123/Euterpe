We ~haven't really~ made a ton of assumptions.

Phase 2 Parts:

We have assumed that it is only the spotlight page that needs to have the rating mechanism.

There is a countdown timer till 30th of June.

The typing effect is visible on the home page of the site for "TOP ARTISTS".

For the audio clips in our search page, each clip is playable for 30 seconds. Audio clips that are podcasts or recitations have a duration of 5 minutes.




Phase3 Parts:

To see the website work, we must run the command "./app.py".

The unique id that each song must have is assumed to be the equivalent of serial number that is generated while storing in the database.
